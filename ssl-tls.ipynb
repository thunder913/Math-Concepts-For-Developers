    "Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications through the use of codes so that only those persons for whom the information is intended can understand and process it. Thus preventing unauthorized access to information. The prefix “crypt” means “hidden” and the suffix “graphy” means “writing”. In Cryptography, the techniques that are used to protect information are obtained from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations known as algorithms to convert messages in ways that make it hard to decode them. These algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, and verification to protect data privacy, web browsing on the internet and to protect confidential transactions such as credit card and debit card transactions. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "It has the following features:\n",
    "- Confidentiality: The communicated information can only be accessed by the person for whom it is intended and nobody else should be able to access it.\n",
    "- Integrity: The received information must remain unaltered, accurate and exact.\n",
    "- Non-repudiation: After sending the message/information, the sender cannot revert it later on. That provides evidence of the communication and is crucial for situations, where accountability and legal disputes arise.\n",
    "- Authentication: This is a mechanism used to verify the identity of the user, system or entity.\n",
    "- Interoperability: It allows for secure communication between different systems and platforms.\n",
    "- Adaptability: Cryptography must continuously evolve and improve to stay ahead of any possible security threats, since one security breach could be fatal."
