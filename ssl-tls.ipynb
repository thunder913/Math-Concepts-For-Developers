    "Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications through the use of codes so that only those persons for whom the information is intended can understand and process it. Thus preventing unauthorized access to information. The prefix “crypt” means “hidden” and the suffix “graphy” means “writing”. In Cryptography, the techniques that are used to protect information are obtained from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations known as algorithms to convert messages in ways that make it hard to decode them. These algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, and verification to protect data privacy, web browsing on the internet and to protect confidential transactions such as credit card and debit card transactions.

    "Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext.

It puts data through multiple encryption rounds and splits a message into smaller 128 bits, which makes it more secure and reliable than older encryption methods. The most widespread algorithm was Data Encryption Standard (DES), but it was very insecure even in the 90s, which created the need for a more realible encryption method. AES quickly became the most popular symmetric key cryptography algorithm. From 2003 even the US government uses it for protecting classified information. dWaht makes it so good is, that it works on byte data instead of bit, so it treats the 128-bit block size as 16 bytes during the encryption procedure and also the number of rounds of encryption to be carried out depends on the length of the data. For example 128-bit size has ten rounds, while the 256-bit has fourteen rounds.\n",

    "\n",
    "  Key exchange mechanisms are essential protocols or algorithms, that enable two or more parties to securely establish shared keys over an insecure communication channel like the internet. They allow entries to share secrets keys safely without the need to havae physically xchanged anything beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Diffie-Hellman**\n",
    "\n",
    "  One of the most popular mechanism is **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** as it is found in security protocols such as TLS, SSH and IPsec. To implement it, two end users (or client and server) mutually agree on positive whole numbers p and q, such that p is a prime number and q is a generator of p. The generator is a number that, when raised to positive whole-number less than p, never produces the same result for any two such whole numbers. p may be large, but q is usually small.\n",
    "  Once the users have agreed on p and q in private, they choose positive whole-number personal keys a and b. Both must be less than the prime number modulus p. Next both parties compute public keys a* and b*, based on their personal keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^* = (q ^ a)\\mod p$$\n",
    "$$b^* = (q ^ b)\\mod p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  Then the users share the public keys a* and b* over the communication channel, thati s insecure. From these public keys, a number x can be generate by either user on the basis of their own personal keys. They use each others calculated number:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = (b^*)\\mod p = (a^*)\\mod p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  That way both parties manage to get the same number, but it is not shared in the insecure environment and so are the private keys. Afterwards the users can safely communicate using encryption methods of their choise using the decryption key x.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Although it seems, that the algorithm can be easily reversed, knowing q, p and a*, it is not that simple. In large numbers and especially, when p is large enough (like 2048 bits), then the brute force attack and other attack methods are not computionally feasible. That is because it should solve Discrete Lograrith Problem, for which there is currently no efficient algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "  - **Rivest-Shamir-Adleman**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. The idea of the algorithm is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer, but easy to multiply large numbers. The public key consists of two numbers where one number is a multiplication of two large prime numbers and the private key is also derived from the same two prime numbers. That meeans if someone can factorize the large number, then the private key will be compromised. Because of that it is best if RSA keys are 2048 bit long, since 1024 bit keys might be broken in  the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The first thing in the algorithm is to choose two prime numbers P and Q. Then we can calculate the first number of the public key:\n",
    "  $$n = P * Q$$\n",
    "  Next a small exponent e must be chosen, that is an integer and is in the range 1 < e < Φ(n). It is usually 65537 in practice or if we are performing some tests it is usually 3 or 17. e is the other part of the public key.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  After that we can calculate the private key using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ d = (k * \\phi(n) + 1)/e $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  Then the encryption/decryption process can begin. We encrypt the data, by converting the letters to numbers 1-26, if using English letters only and using the formula:\n",
    "  $$ encrypted \\: data = (data^e) \\mod n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  The decryption is performed using the formula:\n",
    "\n",

The new length of the message should be 64 bits less than the exact multiple of 512, i.e. if we have 600 bits, we should add 360 bits, so that the length is 960, which is 1024 - 64.

    "### 2.1.3 TLS Protocol Structure and Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS is composed of several protocols, each serving a distinct purpose in the secure communicaiton between the parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Record Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "  The Record Protocol layers on top of a reliable connection-oriented transport, such as TCP. It provides data confidentiality using symmetric key cryptography and data integrity using a keyed Message Authentication Code (MAC). The keys are generated uniquely for each session based on the security parameters agreed during the TLS handshake. The Record Protocol is also used for encapsulating various upper layer protocols – most notably the TLS Handshake Protocol – in which case it can be used without encryption or message authentication. It performs the following operations in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Read messages for transmit.\n",
    "  1. Fragment messages into manageable chunks of data.\n",
    "  1. Compress the data, if compression is required and enabled.\n",
    "  1. Calculate a MAC.\n",
    "  1. Encrypt the data.\n",
    "  1. Transmit the resulting data to the peer.\n",
    "\n",
    "  On the receiver side, the same operations are performed, but in reverse order:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Read received data from the peer.\n",
    "  1. Decrypt the data.\n",
    "  1. Verify the MAC.\n",
    "  1. Decompress the data, if compression is required and enabled.\n",
    "  1. Re-assemble the message fragments.\n",
    "  1. Deliver the message to upper protocol layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handshake Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "  The Handshake Protocol is the most complex part of TLS. It is responsible for the initial negotiation between the client and server, when a connection is first established. It ensures, that both parties have agreed on the security parameters and have exchanged the necessary keys securely, in order to begin their reliable connection. This protocol will be looked in depth in section 2.1.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alert Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "  The Alert Protocol is there to allow signals to be sent between peers. These signals are mostly used to inform the peer about the cause of a protocol failure. Some of these signals are used internally by the protocol and the application protocol does not have to cope with them, and others refer to the application protocol solely. An alert signal includes a level indication which may be either fatal or warning. Fatal alerts always terminate the current connection, and prevent future re-negotiations using the current session ID. Under the newest version of TLS - 1.3, all alerts are fatal and terminate the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Some of the critical alerts are:\n",
    "  - `unexpected_message`: An inappropriate message was received.\n",
    "  - `bad_record_mac`: An incorrect MAC was received.\n",
    "  - `decompression_failure`: The decompression function received improper input.\n",
    "  - `handshake_failure`: Sender was unable to negotiate an acceptable set of security parameters given the options available.\n",
    "  - `illegal_parameter`: A field in a handshake message was out of range or inconsistent with other fields.\n",
    "  - `close_notify`: Notifies the recipient that the sender will not send any more messages on this connection. Each party is required to send a close_notify alert before closing the write side of a connection.\n",
    "  - `no_certificate`: May be sent in response to a certificate request if no appropriate certificate is available.\n",
    "  - `bad_certificate`: A received certificate was corrupt (e.g., contained a signature that did not verify).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change Cipher Spec Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "  The Change Cipher Spec Protocol is a critical component of the TLS suite, as it is designed to signal transitions in security specification during a TLS session. When used, it indicates a change in the encryption and MAC settings, that are used in the secure session. This change usually occurs after the handshake is done, but before the finalizaiton of the security settings. After sending/receiving the Cipher Spec Message, both the client and the server must update their encryption parameter to begin encryping and decrypting the messages using the negotiated settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "  It marks the final part of the negotiation phase of a TLS session. Once all the information for the session has been exchanged and the handshake has been performed, then both the server and the client send the Change Cipher Spec message. Afterwards both parties send a 'Finished' message, which is the first encrypted data, sent using the new security settings. It serves to confirm, that the whole process has been successful and no tampering has occured."

    "### 2.1.4 The TLS Handshake Process\n",
    "\n",
    "  We will look into TLS 1.2 handshake process. In TLS 1.3 the process is a bit simplified, having only one round trip between the client and the server. That is because TLS 1.2 uses a smaller number of cipher suites and the first roundtrip can be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "  <img src=\"./pictures/tls_handshake.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "  In order to begin a TLS communication, the client and server must go through a handshake process. It includes the following steps in the given order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Client Hello** - The client sends the server information including the highest version of TLS that it supports and a list of the cipher suites that it supports. The cipher suite information includes cryptographic algorithms and key sizes.\n",
    "- **Server Hello** - The server chooses the highest version of TLS and the best cipher suite that both the client and server support and sends this information to the client.\n",
    "- **(Optional) Certificate** - The server sends the client a certificate or a certificate chain, typically beginning with the server's public key certificate and ending with the certificate authority's root certificate. This message is used whenever server authentication is required.\n",
    "- **(Optional) Server Key Exchange** - The server sends the client a server key exchange message if the public key information from the Certificate is not sufficient for key exchange. For example, in cipher suites based on Diffie-Hellman (DH), this message contains the server's DH public key.\n",
    "- **Server Hello Done** - The server tells the client that it is finished with its initial negotiation messages.\n",
    "- **Client Key Exchange** - The client generates information used to create a key for symmetric encryption. For RSA, the client then encrypts this key information with the server's public key and sends it to the server. For cipher suites based on DH, this message contains the client's DH public key.\n",
    "- **(Optional) Certificate Verify** - This message is sent by the client when the client presents a certificate as previously explained. Its purpose is to allow the server to complete the process of authenticating the client. When this message is used, the client sends information that it digitally signs using a cryptographic hash function. When the server decrypts this information with the client's public key, the server is able to authenticate the client.\n",
    "- **Change Cipher Spec** - The client sends a message telling the server to change to encrypted mode.\n",
    "- **Finished** - The client tells the server that it is ready for secure data communication to begin.\n",
    "- **Change Cipher Spec** - The server sends a message telling the client to change to encrypted mode.\n",
    "- **Finished** - The server tells the client that it is ready for secure data communication to begin. This is the end of the TLS handshake.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the handshake is performed, now the client and server can transfer encrypted data between one another. At the end of the connection each side sends a close_notify alert to inform the peer, that the connection is closed.  "
