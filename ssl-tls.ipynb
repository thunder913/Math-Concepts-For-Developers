    "Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications through the use of codes so that only those persons for whom the information is intended can understand and process it. Thus preventing unauthorized access to information. The prefix “crypt” means “hidden” and the suffix “graphy” means “writing”. In Cryptography, the techniques that are used to protect information are obtained from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations known as algorithms to convert messages in ways that make it hard to decode them. These algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, and verification to protect data privacy, web browsing on the internet and to protect confidential transactions such as credit card and debit card transactions. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "It has the following features:\n",
    "- Confidentiality: The communicated information can only be accessed by the person for whom it is intended and nobody else should be able to access it.\n",
    "- Integrity: The received information must remain unaltered, accurate and exact.\n",
    "- Non-repudiation: After sending the message/information, the sender cannot revert it later on. That provides evidence of the communication and is crucial for situations, where accountability and legal disputes arise.\n",
    "- Authentication: This is a mechanism used to verify the identity of the user, system or entity.\n",
    "- Interoperability: It allows for secure communication between different systems and platforms.\n",
    "- Adaptability: Cryptography must continuously evolve and improve to stay ahead of any possible security threats, since one security breach could be fatal."

    "Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext. The keys may be identical, or there may be a simple transformation to go between the two keys. The keys, in practice, represent a shared secret between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a private information link. [2]\n",

Each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding private key. Key pairs are generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions.

    "### 1.2 Key Concepts in Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Exchange Mechanisms**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key exchange mechanisms are essential protocols or algorithms, that enable two or more parties to securely establish shared keys over an insecure communication channel like the internet. They allow entries to share secrets keys safely without the need to havae physically xchanged anything beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular mechanism is **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** as it is found in security protocols such as TLS, SSH and IPsec. To implement it, two end users (or client and server) mutually agree on positive whole numbers p and q, such that p is a prime number and q is a generator of p. The generator is a number that, when raised to positive whole-number less than p, never produces the same result for any two such whole numbers. p may be large, but q is usually small.\n",
    "Once the users have agreed on p and q in private, they choose positive whole-number personal keys a and b. Both must be less than the prime number modulus p. Next both parties compute public keys a* and b*, based on their personal keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^* = (q ^ a)\\mod p$$\n",
    "$$b^* = (q ^ b)\\mod p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the users share the public keys a* and b* over the communication channel, thati s insecure. From these public keys, a number x can be generate by either user on the basis of their own personal keys. They use each others calculated number:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = (b^*)\\mod p = (a^*)\\mod p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That way both parties manage to get the same number, but it is not shared in the insecure environment and so are the private keys. Afterwards the users can safely communicate using encryption methods of their choise using the decryption key x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it seems, that the algorithm can be easily reversed, knowing q, p and a*, it is not that simple. In large numbers and especially, when p is large enough (like 2048 bits), then the brute force attack and other attack methods are not computionally feasible. That is because it should solve Discrete Lograrith Problem, for which there is currently no efficient algorithm.\n",
